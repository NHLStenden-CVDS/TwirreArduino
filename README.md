## TwirreArduino firmware
TwirreArduino is software for the Arduino DUE which enables it to easily be used for sensor and actuator communication together with TwirreLink software. It has been designed to be easy-to-use, modular and extendable. The generic structure enables a large amount of devices to be integrated into the TwirreLink system.

## TwirreSerial
TwirreArduino includes the TwirreSerial protocol for communication between the Arduino DUE and a computer running TwirreLink software. The protocol specification can be found here: <https://github.com/NHLStenden-CVDS/Twirre/releases/download/doc-alpha/twirreSerialProtocol.pdf>

## How to Build
TwirreArduino can be loaded, compiled and flashed by the Arduino IDE. The sensors and actuators can be configured in the **uav_interface.ino** file. 

## License
TwirreArduino has been made available under the MIT license (see **LICENSE**).

## Examples
Examples to be added at a later date
